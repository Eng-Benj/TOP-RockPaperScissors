# TOP-RockPaperScissors
The second full project assignment of TOP's Foundations Course.

The aim of this assignment was to create a 5-round game of rock paper scissors. The script would select the computer's weapon at random, ask the user to select their own weapon, and determine the winner of the round. It would then repeat this process a further 4 times, keeping track of the round outcomes and declaring a winner at the end.
